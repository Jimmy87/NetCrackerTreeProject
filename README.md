# NAME
Abstract Tree (Laboratory #5)

# DESCRIPTION
**Abstract Tree** is a programm that works with some abstract tree organised data. Programm has functions for working with tree and it's components.
## Main functions:
    1. Create/delete tree
    2. Add/delete node(or branch of nodes)
    3. Split tree branch, i.e. current node should be replaced
       with it's child nodes and links in parent node
       should be redirected to child nodes of replaced one.
    4. Tree cloning(deep copy)
    5. Node search(by ID or some other value)
    6. Tree ordering: each branch in ordered tree in ordered tree
       should meet requirement, that all child nodes have to
       contain ID that is less or equal than one their parent node has.
    7. Methods implementing saving and reading to HDD storage.
    8. Ability to work with multiple trees at the same time, copy
       and insert tree parts between these trees.
    9. Programming code should fall into Java Code Conventions and
       be supplied with JavaDoc.

## Possible modifications:
    1. Disk storage.
    2. Different search criteria.
    3. Different ways of ordering(using comparator).
